# Obsidian Copy Files

Whenever you write a document in Obsidian, you often need to copy the files in it to a destination directory at regular intervals. For example, for layout or something else. It's too much trouble to copy files manually from a folder every time, so I saved up and wrote this plugin to make sure that you can copy the corresponding files to the corresponding directory with one line of command.
